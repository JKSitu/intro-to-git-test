The examples require codecarbon to be downloaded into this top level directory.
Codecarbon will report (with limitations) how much Carbon your Python code causes to me emitted when it is run.

Codecarbon source and documentation is available from: git@github.com:mlco2/codecarbon.git

To install you do not need the source but (Linux) can use
pip install codecarbon
